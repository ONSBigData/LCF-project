Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) Project repository

# Overview

The ONS Big Data team was approached by ONS Social Survey Division (SSD) about the possibility of using 
commercial data and/or data science methods to help improve the processing of the 
Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF).

In order to facilitate the LCF diary process, two prototypes were developed by the Big Data Team in consultation with 
the Social Survey Division, Surveys and Life Events Processing and the end user DEFRA. 
The proposed solutions harness information from clean historic LCF diary data to help complete 
missing product quantity information (i.e. amount, volume or weight purchased) at the point of data entry.
